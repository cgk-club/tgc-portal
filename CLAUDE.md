## What This Project Is

The Gatekeepers Club (TGC) Itinerary Portal — a Next.js 14 web application deployed at `portal.thegatekeepers.club`. Built for Christian de Jabrun, founder of TGC, a quiet luxury concierge service based in the South of France.

**Two surfaces:**
1. **Admin** (`/admin`) — password-protected, for Christian only. Manage fiches, build itineraries, generate quotes, manage clients, send supplier outreach.
2. **Public** — fiche pages (`/fiche/[slug]`), itinerary pages (`/itinerary/[shareToken]`), quote pages (`/quote/[quoteToken]`), client portal (`/client`).

## Airtable Schema (Organizations table)

Key field names — use exactly these strings:
```
"Organization Name"   → name
"Organization Type"   → category (generic: "Supplier")
"Category Parent"     → categoryParent
"Category Sub"        → categorySub (specific: "Boutique Hotels", "Restaurants" etc.)
"Country"             → country
"City"                → city
"Website"             → website
"Email General"       → email
"Phone General"       → phone
```

**Critical:** Airtable field names have changed from assumed defaults.
Never use "Name", "Category", "Email", "Phone" — always use the full field names above.

---

## Supabase Tables

```
fiches                  — enriched supplier presentation layer
itineraries             — client itinerary records
itinerary_days          — day structure within itinerary
itinerary_items         — fiche or note items within a day
client_accounts         — client portal accounts
magic_tokens            — magic link auth tokens
outreach_log            — supplier outreach email log
webhook_log             — Airtable webhook audit log
```

**Key columns added across phases (always use IF NOT EXISTS):**
- `fiches`: hero_image_url, headline, description, highlights, gallery_urls, tags, status, slug, template_type, template_fields, show_price, price_display, latitude, longitude, geocoded_at
- `itinerary_items`: item_type, exact_time, unit_price, quantity, is_zero_margin, is_included
- `itineraries`: start_date, cover_image_url, is_member, quote_status, quote_token, client_email, client_account_id

**Storage bucket:** `fiche-images` (public read)

## Fiche Template System

Templates are auto-detected from Airtable `Category Sub` on fiche creation.
Mapping lives in `lib/ficheTemplates.ts`. Updated 19 March 2026 after taxonomy cleanup.

| `dining` | Independent Restaurants, Fine Dining, Casual Dining, Private Chefs, Cafés & Patisseries, Beach Clubs & Pool Bars, Private Dining Experiences |
| `maker` | Traditional Crafts, Contemporary Design, Jewellery & Accessories, Fashion & Tailoring, Ceramics & Pottery, Glasswork, Textile & Weaving, Furniture & Cabinetry, Perfumery & Beauty, Food & Artisan Produce |
| `experience` | Cultural Tours & Guided Experiences, Adventure & Outdoor, Culinary Experiences & Classes, Photography Experiences, Music & Arts Experiences, Private Access & VIP Experiences, Safari & Wildlife |
| `transport` | Private Aviation, Commercial Aviation, Helicopter Services, Yacht Charters, Boat & River Cruises, Luxury Transfers, Car Rental, Luxury Car Rental, Rail & Train Travel, Chauffeur Services |

## TGC Pricing Logic (Quote Builder)

```
Planning fee tiers (on commissionable total):
  < €50k:        5%
  €50–100k:      4%
  €100–250k:     3%
  €250–500k:     2%
  €500k–€1M:     1.5%
  > €1M:         negotiate

Minimum fee: €500
Members: zero fee
Flights + restaurant reservations: zero margin (pass-through only)
Points: 0.5pt/€1 (non-member), 1pt/€1 (member). 100pts = €1.
Fee is DEDUCTED from budget, never added on top.
Never show planning fee as a line item on client-facing documents.
```

## Deployment

Every `git push` to `main` auto-deploys to Railway.
Build uses Docker with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag (required for react-leaflet).
Server binds to `0.0.0.0` and `process.env.PORT` (Railway requirement — set in Dockerfile).

```bash
# Standard deploy
cd ~/tgc-portal
git add .
git commit -m "Description"
git push
```

---

## Known Issues & Decisions

- **react-leaflet peer dependency:** Dockerfile uses `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` — do not remove this flag
- **Leaflet + SSR:** All map components use `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })` — never import Leaflet directly in server components
- **Airtable write-back:** Generally read-only. Exception: outreach emails write a record to the Interactions table
- **Admin auth:** Simple HTTP-only cookie session, no OAuth. Single operator tool.
- **Client auth:** Magic link via Resend, **24-hour token expiry** (single use), 30-day session cookie. Ruled by Christian 10 Aug 2026: 24 hours is the default everywhere, for security. Admin-sent links (`/api/admin/clients/[id]/send-link`, `/api/admin/partners/[id]/send-link`) previously issued 7 days and now match.
- **RLS:** Enabled on ALL 44 tables (security audit 28 Mar 2026). Admin tables use service-role-only access. Public read policies scoped to shared/live/published status. Client/partner INSERT policies enforce user_id = auth.uid().

---

## What Each Phase Built

- **Phase 1:** Fiche system + admin + Airtable connection + Railway deploy
- **Phase 2:** Itinerary builder + client view + PDF export
- **Phase 3A:** Maps + quote builder + mobile optimisation + cover images + quick wins
- **Phase 3B:** Client portal (magic link) + supplier outreach emails
- **Phase 4:** Typed fiche templates (hospitality/villa/dining/maker/default)
- **Phase 5:** Airtable webhook automation — auto-creates draft fiches from new orgs
- **Phase 6:** Six new fiche templates (experience, transport, wine estate, wellness, events/sport, arts/culture)
- **Phase 12 — Intelligence Suite (18 Apr 2026):** Three public intelligence tools at `/intelligence/[transport|realestate|wellness]`, plus landing page at `/intelligence`. Submit API at `/api/intelligence/submit` (Resend email to jeeves@ + client confirmation). lucide-react added.

---

## Intelligence Suite

Routes: `/intelligence`, `/intelligence/transport`, `/intelligence/realestate`, `/intelligence/wellness`

- **Transport:** 60 corridors (9 added 18 Apr: Monaco-Courchevel, Monaco-Sardinia, Paris-Bordeaux, London-Edinburgh, Barcelona-Ibiza, Palma-Ibiza, Athens-Santorini, Miami-Palm Beach, LA-Santa Barbara), asset economics calculator, localStorage journey saving
- **Real estate:** 31 markets, 3 mandate flows (acquire/dispose/retain), structuring screen (FR: ≥€1.3M, UK: ≥£2M, other: ≥€5M), mandate letter generator. Jez Moore (Tier 1 high-end), Keith Kirwen (Andalusia), Amélie Rigo exclusives (Occitanie). Off-market framing throughout.
- **Wellness:** 12 clinics, 6-question matching engine, annual programme economics calculator. Lanserhof marked TGC Active.
- **Submit API:** POST `/api/intelligence/submit` — accepts `{type, brief, client, corridor?, market?}`, sends formatted Resend email to jeeves@, sends confirmation to client.
- **Events + Art:** Coming soon (no pages yet)

Public lead magnet: `intelligence.thegatekeepers.club` should CNAME to `portal.thegatekeepers.club` (DNS not yet configured).

## Current State (update this section after each session)

*Last updated: 18 April 2026*

- Portal live at portal.thegatekeepers.club
- 11 fiche templates, transport + events sub-layouts
- Phase 5 webhook endpoint live
- Airtable Organizations table ID: `tblRiQuIfeQ34aN5L`
- Magic link auth: 24-hour token expiry (single use), 30-day session cookie
- Human-like typing effect on all chat modules (variable speed, typos, cursor)
- One-question-at-a-time chat flow across all prompts
- Client chat skips known details (email, name) for logged-in users
- Project dashboards: per-project (event hero, countdown, revenue, tasks) + list page (summary cards, deadlines)
- Per-partner visibility controls: 7 granular toggles (financials, tasks, docs, activity, guests, sponsors, budget)
- Task system: multi-partner assignment, priority, status tracking
- View separation enforced at API level (admin/partner/client)
- Event packages table (event_packages) + event guests table (event_guests)
- Project tasks table (project_tasks)
- Partner visibility settings column on project_partners
- Approvals + requests badges refresh instantly (custom event dispatch)
- Requests page has status workflow (new → contacted → quoted → confirmed → closed)
- Resend domain verified for thegatekeepers.club
- **Fiche publish flow (fixed 30 Jun 2026):** Approving a partner's fiche edit (`/api/admin/fiche-edits/[id]` action:approve) now promotes a still-`draft` fiche to `live` automatically (respecting the ≥4 gallery-image guard). Previously approval applied content but left status `draft`, so the public `/fiche/[slug]` link 404'd while `?preview=true` worked. To publish a fiche outside that flow, use the editor (`PATCH /api/admin/fiches/[id]` `{status:'live'}`, also enforces ≥4 images).
- **Stale-cache 404 (fixed 30 Jun 2026):** The fiche page used to read a stale `draft` status from the Next.js Data Cache after publishing, 404ing until the next redeploy. `app/fiche/[slug]/page.tsx` now sets `fetchCache = 'force-no-store'` + `noStore()`, so a publish reflects immediately. `?preview=true` returning 200 while the bare URL 404s is the diagnostic that the status gate (not the data) is the issue.
- `.claude/` added to .gitignore — worktree files must never be committed
- **Client sign-in fixed (10 Aug 2026).** Four faults in one flow, all found while preparing a client email:
  1. `/client/login` **opened in password mode by default**. Only 4 of 14 client accounts have a password, so 10 of them entered an email, got "Invalid email or password", and stopped. **Magic link is now the default**; password is opt in via `?mode=password`.
  2. The page accepts **`?email=`** to prefill, so a link mailed to a client lands on one filled-in field and one button. This is the link to put in client emails: `/client/login?email=<their address>`.
  3. `?error=invalid`, which `/api/client/verify` already redirected to when a token was expired or reused, **was never read by the page**. The client saw a blank login form and no explanation. It now shows a message and offers a fresh link.
  4. The session cookie was `sameSite: 'strict'` on **both** verify routes. A magic link is clicked from a mail client, so the landing is a cross-site navigation and a strict cookie is withheld on the redirect that follows, bouncing the client back to login. Now `lax` on `/api/client/verify` and `/api/partner/verify`. Password login routes keep `strict` (same-site POST, genuine hardening).
- **Email copy said 7 days on a 24-hour link** (`lib/email.ts`, client and partner). Copy corrected rather than the token, per the ruling above.
- **`appUrl || request.url` removed from `/api/client/verify`.** That is deploy trap 4: behind the Railway proxy a route handler sees the internal address, so a missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` would redirect the client to `localhost:8080`. Now falls back to the literal domain like every other caller.

## Things That Must Not Change

- Airtable field name mappings (breaking change if modified)
- Supabase table names
- The `share_token` and `quote_token` URL patterns (clients may have saved links)
- `/fiche/[slug]` URL structure (may be shared with external parties)
- TGC brand colours and font choices
